# MachineLearningCoursera
my solution of coursera machine learning code assignments

## ex2 note
1. the `mapFeature.m` is very usefull  
   we can fit some features into **polynomial**
2. I need to know the differences between **fminunc** algorithm and gradient decent

## ex3 note
1. I need to know the differences between fmincg algorithm and fminunc algorithm
2. In the neral network inference:
   The bias adding process is **after** sigmoid activation
   ```code
   z2 = a1 * Theta1';
   a2 = [ones(m, 1) sigmoid(z2)];
   ```

## ex4 note
1. To further consider the checkNNGradients function process, and use it in my own work
2. The visual of the network, features and loss.
